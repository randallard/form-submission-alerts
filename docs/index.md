# System Reliability Documentation

This document outlines the core reliability features and architecture of our system, detailing how we ensure robust, secure, and maintainable operations across all components.

## Overview

Our system implements a comprehensive reliability strategy across multiple layers:
- Client-side reliability through Rust and device-based authentication
- Transport-layer security with request signing and idempotency
- Server-side reliability using AWS's distributed infrastructure
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability

## Core Reliability Features

### Language-Level Reliability

The system is built primarily in Rust, providing fundamental reliability guarantees:

- Memory and thread safety through Rust's ownership model
- Strong type system preventing common runtime errors
- Compile-time verification of correctness
- No garbage collection pauses affecting performance

### Device Authentication

Our device-based authentication system provides robust security:

- Integration with system-level certificate store
- Independence from external authentication services
- Offline functionality post-device registration
- Certificate persistence through system updates

### Transport Layer Security

The transport layer implements multiple reliability mechanisms:

- Request signing for integrity verification
- Independent verification for each request
- Idempotency keys preventing duplicate submissions
- Intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### AWS Infrastructure

The AWS backend ensures high availability and scalability:

- Lambda functions distributed across multiple Availability Zones
- DynamoDB with built-in replication
- Automatic scaling for handling load spikes
- Redundant notification services (SES/SNS)

### Comprehensive Logging

Our logging system maintains complete operational visibility:

- Structured logging for all operations
- Complete audit trail capability
- Real-time system health metrics
- Anomaly detection and alerting

### Error Recovery

The system implements robust error handling:

- Tracked submission failures with retry capability
- Independent notification failure tracking
- Partial failure recovery mechanisms
- Detailed error states for debugging

### Storage Reliability

DynamoDB provides our reliable storage layer:

- 99.999% availability guarantee
- Multi-AZ data replication
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Automated backup systems

### Eliminating Single Points of Failure

The system architecture eliminates single points of failure through:

- Device-local authentication
- Multiple notification pathways (email + SMS)
- Distributed AWS infrastructure
- Independent logging systems

### Operational Monitoring

CloudWatch provides comprehensive monitoring:

- Real-time system visibility
- Performance metric tracking
- Immediate issue alerting
- Historical trend analysis

### Implementation Details

The implementation focuses on reliability:

- Comprehensive error handling in Rust
- Operation timeout controls
- Guaranteed resource cleanup
- Clear transaction boundaries

## Considered Alternatives

Several alternative approaches were considered and rejected:

- Redpanda/event streaming (determined to be excessive for current needs)
- Web-based form implementation (native apps were required)
- Traditional user authentication (device authentication chosen instead)
